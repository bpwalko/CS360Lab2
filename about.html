        Hello, in case you didn't see on the home page my name is Robert Walko, I'm a Computer Science undergraduate
	student at the University of Idaho: <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/">University of Idaho Home Page</a> My 
	primary focus is in Cybersecurity, I've taken classes on basic cyber principles, Information Assurance, Digital 
	Forensics, Penetration Testing, and Network Security. I have a standard CS background as well, I'm familiar with 
	most common programming languages, with Python and C/C++ where I have the most experience. I've used database
	systems both in school for our Database Systems class, and in research projects. I am also a recipient of the NSF
	Scholarship for Service, where NSF pays for our education on the condition that we work six months for a federal
	executive agency for every semester they cover. This program prepares students for a career including their written
	and spoken communication abilities, interview skills, ethics as it relates to information technology, and 
	ability to prepare and deliver quality presentations. I have also led teams in two cyber security competitions,
	one was the Spokane 4th Annual Mayor's Cybercup in which we placed 1st out of 18 teams, and the NCAE cybergames 2023
	in which we placed 2nd out of 12 teams.

        I've completed two summer internships, one at the University of Idaho and one at the Institute for Defense Analyses.
	At the University of Idaho, I set up secure environments for cybersecurity labs, I became familiar with 
	Faronics Deep Freeze, VMware Workstation, Clonezilla, and Microsoft SCCM now known as Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM).
	At the institute for Defense Analyses, I worked on a software fuzzing tool that was designed to compare usable code
	with formal models. The first thing I implemented was coverage statistics using the Gnu Compiler Collection tool gcov.
	This showed how much of the program had been reached by the fuzzing inputs we generated. The next thing I implemented
	was a tool to help identify where errors were in the code. The last thing I did was modify the fuzzing tool such that
	it could accept formal models as a ground truth. Initially it took known good C code and compared it to artifically
	flawed C code. I made it such that it could accept and run NuSMV formal models as the known good, such that it could
	run on an actual program we were developing and wanted to test.
